This notebook allows you to to:
	* Rapidly set up a STARLING environment
	* Generate a STARLING ensemble
	* Save that ensemble as a PDB, PDB/XTC, or .starling file 
	* Build a scaling map to describe intra-residue distance distributions
	* Generate histograms for the radius of gyration or inter-residue distance.
	* In addition - if there are extra analyses you'd like to see here please don't hesitate to let use know!
