## About
IDPColab is a resource for linking Google Colab notebooks associated with [Holehouse lab](https://www.holehouselab.com/)-developed analysis tools. The main goal is to centralize links and provide brief descriptions of what different colab notebooks do. It also means if issues arise, it's easy for anyone to raise an issue here, and then individual notebooks can be fixed. It also means people can request specific notebooks if they want.

## What is a colab notebook?
A Google Colab notebook, part of [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), is a free cloud service based on Jupyter Notebooks that allows anyone to write and execute arbitrary Python code through the browser. It's particularly popular among scientists, machine learning folks, and data scientists due to its ease of use and no-setup-required approach. 

Colab notebooks offer the following features:

* **Interactive Environment**: Google Colab provides an interactive environment where you can write, run, and share Python code. It supports Markdown for adding rich text elements, such as images, links, and equations, making it ideal for collaborative projects and educational purposes.

* **Zero Configuration**: One of the key benefits of Google Colab is that it requires no setup. You can start coding immediately without worrying about installing any software on your local machine.

* **Access to Free GPUs and TPUs**: Google Colab offers free access to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which can significantly speed up computation times for machine learning and deep learning tasks. This makes it accessible for individuals and organizations without high-performance computing resources. It is also possible to pay a relatively modest fee for greater access to resources.

## This sounds great - how do I use a Colab notebook?
You need just a few things:

* **Internet Connection**: Being a cloud-based service, a stable internet connection is required to access and work on Colab notebooks.

* **Web Browser**: Google Colab runs in your web browser, so you need a modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.

* **Google Account**: You need a Google account to access and save Colab notebooks to Google Drive.

And that's it! The notebooks linked here should all be point-and-click style, so they do not require you to have any coding knowledge.
